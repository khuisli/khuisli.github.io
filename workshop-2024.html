        <p> 
          We are excited to announce the 2024 Joint Workshops on Fragments, a collaborative event hosted by Kyung Hee University's Institute for the Study of Language and Information (KHU-ISLI), the Language Variation and Textual Categorization group at the University of Vigo (UVigo-LVTC), and the Joint Workshop on Linguistics and Language Processing (JWLLP). 
          <br />
          <br />
          This year, we will hold two workshop sessions: the first in Vigo, Spain, and the second in Seoul, Korea.
           <br />
          <br />
          We look forward to productive and inspiring sessions.
          <br />

          <h4>Getting there</h4>

          The easiest way to get there is by walking 500m from the U-Bahn (Underground) station “Mundsburg”, which is about a 7
          Minute ride away from the central station (“Hauptbahnhof”).<br />
          <br />
          It’s probably not a good idea to try to go by car, as parking space is very limited and even on a saturday, we can’t
          really recommend driving in Hamburgs inner city.<br />
          <br />
          If you are arriving from Hamburg Airport, you should take the S-Bahn (Metro) to Barmbek and then the U-Bahn to
          Mundsburg.<br />
          <br />

          <h4>Surroundings</h4>

          The Venue is right next to the Eilbekkanal, a channel that runs directly to the Alster lake (“Aussenalster”) which is
          probably a 30 minute walk but especially worth it on a sunny summer day.

        <h3>## Hamburg</h3>

        <p>
          Quoting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg">Wikipedia</a>:

          <blockquote>
            Hamburg, officially the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg, is the second-largest city in Germany after Berlin and 8th
            largest city in the European Union with a population of over 1.8 million.
          </blockquote>

          Getting to Hamburg is easy. By bike, train, car, plane - even by boat.
          The <a href="https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Hamburg">Wikivoyage travel guide</a> sums up everything
          you need to know about getting to and getting around Hamburg, finding a place to stay or even moving here.

      <h2># Contact</h2>

      Latest news were published on our Twitter feed. You can easily leave us a note on Twitter, but via GitHub Issue
      or e-mail is also fine. On the conference itself we ask our participants if it's ok to have pictures taken with
      them. We won't publish pictures of people opting out of that. In case we accidentally did please leave us a note
      so we can remove the image.
