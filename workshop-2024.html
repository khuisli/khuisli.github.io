        <p>
          It is with heavy hearts that we have decided to cancel this year’s Unconf, due to the current corona pandemic.
          <br />
          <br />
          We want to host a safe and worry-free conference, which, unfortunately, is not going to be possible this year. We believe that not holding the RubyUnconf this year is the most responsible course of action.
          <br />
          At this moment in time, we also believe it would not be right to speculate and postpone the Unconf to a later date. As a result of this, we have therefore decided to cancel this year’s RubyUnconf and have refunded all ticket orders.
          <br />
          <br />
          If you do happen to have any questions we would be happy to answer them at info@rubyunconf.eu and help where we can.
          <br />
          <br />
          Despite the bad news, we hope that you can understand our decision and continue to support us at the next RubyUnconf.
          <br />
          <br />
          Thank you for your understanding, stay safe
          <br />
          <br />

      <p>
        What exactly is an Unconference? It is an Barcamp style event. It works like this: Everybody can propose a talk.
        Everybody votes for the talks they want to see. The most voted talks will be held. You decide what will happen!
      </p>

      <div>
        <h3 id="prepare-a-talk">## Prepare a talk</h3>

        <p>
          We recommend to prepare slides for your talk. The talk length will be half an hour. You get the chance to pitch your
          talk at the beginning of each conference day. Besides talks different formats like workshops or panel discussions are
          welcome.

        <h3>## Venue</h3>

        <div class="map">
          <div id="map"></div>
        </div>

        <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Finkenau+35%2C+22081+Hamburg&iaxm=maps&atb=v116-1&ia=maps">
          <h4>HAW Hamburg</h4>
          <h4>Campus Finkenau</h4>
          Finkenau 35<br />

          <h4>Getting there</h4>

          The easiest way to get there is by walking 500m from the U-Bahn (Underground) station “Mundsburg”, which is about a 7
          Minute ride away from the central station (“Hauptbahnhof”).<br />
          <br />
          It’s probably not a good idea to try to go by car, as parking space is very limited and even on a saturday, we can’t
          really recommend driving in Hamburgs inner city.<br />
          <br />
          If you are arriving from Hamburg Airport, you should take the S-Bahn (Metro) to Barmbek and then the U-Bahn to
          Mundsburg.<br />
          <br />

          <h4>Surroundings</h4>

          The Venue is right next to the Eilbekkanal, a channel that runs directly to the Alster lake (“Aussenalster”) which is
          probably a 30 minute walk but especially worth it on a sunny summer day.

        <h3>## Hamburg</h3>

        <p>
          Quoting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg">Wikipedia</a>:

          <blockquote>
            Hamburg, officially the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg, is the second-largest city in Germany after Berlin and 8th
            largest city in the European Union with a population of over 1.8 million.
          </blockquote>

          Getting to Hamburg is easy. By bike, train, car, plane - even by boat.
          The <a href="https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Hamburg">Wikivoyage travel guide</a> sums up everything
          you need to know about getting to and getting around Hamburg, finding a place to stay or even moving here.

      Latest news were published on our Twitter feed. You can easily leave us a note on Twitter, but via GitHub Issue
      or e-mail is also fine. On the conference itself we ask our participants if it's ok to have pictures taken with
      them. We won't publish pictures of people opting out of that. In case we accidentally did please leave us a note
      so we can remove the image.
