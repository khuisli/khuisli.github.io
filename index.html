      <h2># Unconf</h2>

      <p>
        What exactly is an Unconference? It is an Barcamp style event. It works like this: Everybody can propose a talk.
        Everybody votes for the talks they want to see. The most voted talks will be held. You decide what will happen!
      </p>

          <div id="map"></div>
        </div>

        <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Finkenau+35%2C+22081+Hamburg&iaxm=maps&atb=v116-1&ia=maps">
          <h4>HAW Hamburg</h4>

        <p>
          <h4>Getting there</h4>

          The easiest way to get there is by walking 500m from the U-Bahn (Underground) station “Mundsburg”, which is about a 7
          Minute ride away from the central station (“Hauptbahnhof”).<br />
          <br />
          It’s probably not a good idea to try to go by car, as parking space is very limited and even on a saturday, we can’t
          really recommend driving in Hamburgs inner city.<br />
          <br />
          If you are arriving from Hamburg Airport, you should take the S-Bahn (Metro) to Barmbek and then the U-Bahn to
          Mundsburg.<br />
          <br />

          <h4>Surroundings</h4>

          The Venue is right next to the Eilbekkanal, a channel that runs directly to the Alster lake (“Aussenalster”) which is
          probably a 30 minute walk but especially worth it on a sunny spring day.
