        <h3 id="pwww">## Pay what you want</h3>

        <p>
          This year, we are trying something new in the way we are pricing our tickets. The inspiration comes from JS Unconf
          who have tried a model like this before and had good results.<br />
          <br />
          We want to set our prices as low as possible, so that students, newcomers and Rubyists looking for a job can still
          participate. But we also want to give the people who want to support others and have the means, the opportunity to do
          so.<br />
          <br />
          So, we will keep our prices from last year as <b><i>the "recommended" ticket price of 65€</i></b>. If you want to donate extra money
          that will go towards a conference that is more inclusive for everyone, feel free to increase your ticket price. The
          minimum price for a ticket will be 45€, which we hope will be less prohibitive for potential participants with money
          issues.<br />
          <br />
          So what do you get for any money you decide to pay over the recommended amount? You get a more inclusive conference.
          You are supporting someone who couldn’t afford the recommended price and bought a minimal price ticket.
          The money goes towards our diversity program to invite more people from underrepresented minorities to our Unconf, who
          wouldn’t be able to make it otherwise.
          It also goes towards providing childcare at the conference so more parents can attend.<br />
          <br />
          We hope these changes will make the conference a more diverse and inclusive place for all Rubyists.

      <h2># Unconf</h2>

      <p>
        What exactly is an Unconference? It is an Barcamp style event. It works like this: Everybody can propose a talk.
        Everybody votes for the talks they want to see. The most voted talks will be held. You decide what will happen!
      </p>

        <h3 id="prepare-a-talk">## Prepare a talk</h3>

        <p>
          We recommend to prepare slides for your talk. The talk length will be half an hour. You get the chance to pitch your
          talk at the beginning of each conference day. Besides talks different formats like workshops or panel discussions are
          welcome.

        <p>
          2020 will be the third Ruby Unconf. The <a href="https://2018.rubyunconf.eu/">first one took place in 2018</a>.<br />
          For a recap of the <a href="https://2019.rubyunconf.eu">2019 Ruby Unconf</a> we have compiled a
          <a href="https://2019.rubyunconf.eu/2019/11/22/recap.html">Recap</a> to give you a little insight.

        <div class="map">
          <div id="map"></div>
        </div>

        <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Finkenau+35%2C+22081+Hamburg&iaxm=maps&atb=v116-1&ia=maps">
          <h4>HAW Hamburg</h4>
          <h4>Campus Finkenau</h4>
          Finkenau 35<br />
          22081 Hamburg
        </a>
        <br />
        <br />

        <p>
          <h4>Getting there</h4>

          The easiest way to get there is by walking 500m from the U-Bahn (Underground) station “Mundsburg”, which is about a 7
          Minute ride away from the central station (“Hauptbahnhof”).<br />
          <br />
          It’s probably not a good idea to try to go by car, as parking space is very limited and even on a saturday, we can’t
          really recommend driving in Hamburgs inner city.<br />
          <br />
          If you are arriving from Hamburg Airport, you should take the S-Bahn (Metro) to Barmbek and then the U-Bahn to
          Mundsburg.<br />
          <br />

          <h4>Surroundings</h4>

          The Venue is right next to the Eilbekkanal, a channel that runs directly to the Alster lake (“Aussenalster”) which is
          probably a 30 minute walk but especially worth it on a sunny summer day.

        <p>
          Quoting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg">Wikipedia</a>:

          <blockquote>
            Hamburg, officially the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg, is the second-largest city in Germany after Berlin and 8th
            largest city in the European Union with a population of over 1.8 million.
          </blockquote>

          Getting to Hamburg is easy. By bike, train, car, plane - even by boat.
          The <a href="https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Hamburg">Wikivoyage travel guide</a> sums up everything
          you need to know about getting to and getting around Hamburg, finding a place to stay or even moving here.

        <h3>## Food</h3>

        <p>
          This year we only want to provide vegetarian food like last year. In the morning there will be breakfast with sandwiches.
          After the first talks there will be a vegetarian lunch and in the afternoon you can enjoy (oder vielleicht sweeten) your
          break with coffee and cake.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h3>## Childcare</h3>

        <p>
          A special offer for you is childcare. If you wish, you can place your child/children in the hands of qualified carers.
          There will be enough toys and activities so that there is no room for boredom. At the moment the childcare is for children
          from 3 years. However, it is also possible to offer childcare for younger children.

      Latest news were published on our Twitter feed. You can easily leave us a note on Twitter, but via GitHub Issue
      or e-mail is also fine. On the conference itself we ask our participants if it's ok to have pictures taken with
      them. We won't publish pictures of people opting out of that. In case we accidentally did please leave us a note
      so we can remove the image.
